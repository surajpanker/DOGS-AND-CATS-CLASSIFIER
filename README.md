# DOGS-AND-CATS-CLASSIFIER
USING  CNN
In this project, our task is to develop an algorithm to classify images of dogs and cats, 
which is the Dogs vs. Cats . We mainly investigated two approaches to address this problem.
The ﬁrst one is a traditional pattern recognition model .This method to extract some human-crafted features like color and Dense-SIFT, 
represented images using bag of words model, and then trained Support Vector Machines(SVMs) classiﬁers. For the second approach,
we used Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn features of images and trained Backpropagation(BP) Neural Networks and 
SVMs for classiﬁcation. We tried various experiments to improve our performance on the test dataset, and ﬁnally got the best result  by the second approach.
